# Books and Breweries - A Place To Connect 

## Project Description 
This is a website where you can search and save books and breweries in one place! We wanted to create a website where you could find breweries that had good drinks, good snacks and a space where you could enjoy your book or even host a book club!

## User Story
Megan is 36 and single in Seattle. She is an avid book reader and is always on the hunt for a spooky mystery novel. She checks goodreads often, but it only shows her books and reviews. Megan enjoys an interesting sour beer but the brewery close to her apartment only has bar stools and is always full of college kids. 

She would love to be able to search and save breweries she wants to try out and view a list of the books she wants to read/is currently reading in one place.
